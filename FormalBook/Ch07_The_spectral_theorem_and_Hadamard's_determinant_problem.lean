open Matrix

theorem Theorem₁ (n : ℕ) (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ) (h : IsHermitian A) :
    ∃ Q : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℝ,
    Q ∈ Matrix.orthogonalGroup (Fin n) ℝ ∧
    ∃ (d : (Fin n) → ℝ), diagonal d = (Q.conjTranspose * A * Q) := by
  sorry


theorem Theorem₂ (n : ℕ) : ∃ (M : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℤ),
    (∀ i j, M i j = -1 ∨ M i j = 1) ∧
    M.det > Real.sqrt n.factorial := by
  sorry
