Let $\langle a, b \rangle$ be an inner product on a real vector space $V$ (with the norm $|a|^2 := \langle a, a \rangle$). Then
\[
\langle a, b \rangle^2 \leq |a|^2 |b|^2
\]
holds for all vectors $a, b \in V$, with equality if and only if $a$ and $b$ are linearly dependent.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \leanok
The following (folklore) proof is probably the shortest. Consider the quadratic function
\[
|x a + b|^2 = x^2 |a|^2 + 2x \langle a, b \rangle + |b|^2
\]
in the variable $x$. We may assume $a \neq 0$. If $b = \lambda a$, then clearly
\[
\langle a, b \rangle^2 = |a|^2 |b|^2.
\]
If, on the other hand, $a$ and $b$ are linearly independent, then $|x a + b|^2 > 0$ for all $x$,
and thus the discriminant $\langle a, b \rangle^2 - |a|^2 |b|^2$ is less than 0.

\begin{theorem}[First proof]
  \label{ch20theoremIIproof1}
  \lean{harmonic_geometric_arithmetic₁}
  Let $a_1, \dots a_n$ be positive real numbers, then
  \[
  \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1}+\dots+\frac{1}{n_n}} \le
    \sqrt[n]{a_1a_2\dots a_n} \le
    \frac{a_1\dots a_n}{n}
  \]
 with equality in both cases if and only if all $a_i$'s are equal.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{ch20theorem1}
  Suppose all roots fo the polynomial
  $x^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_0$ are real.
  Then the roots of are contained in the interval with the endpoints
  \[
  -\frac{n_{n-1}}{n}\pm\frac{n - 1}{n}\sqrt{a^n_{n - 1} - \frac{2n}{n - 1}a_{n - 2}}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{ch20theorem2} Let $f(x)$ be a real polynomial of defree $n \ge 2$ with only real
  roots, such that $f(x)> 0$ for $ -1 < x < 1$ amd $f(-1) = f(1) = 0$. Then
  \[
  \frac{2}{3}T \le A \le \frac{2}{3}R,
  \]
  and equality holds in both cases only for $n=2$.
